      "user_input": "Is there a centralized ITS warehouse to store equipments?",
      "reference": "No there is not a centralized ITS warehouse to store equipment. Business units are responsible for storing items.",
      "retrieved_context": "## 4.1 E-Equipment\n\nE-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers, printers, and data center equipment. The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO) guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA Service Request.\n\nAs established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment, no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before turning over equipment to ITS.\n\nITS Facilities Services will work with the business unit to review the form. If the form is complete, ITS Facilities Services will approve and authorize the disposal of furniture or miscellaneous equipment. If the form is incomplete, it will be returned to the requestor for revision. Furniture and miscellaneous equipment cannot be removed without the proper approval and authorization as indicated above.\n\nIn all cases, until a final determination is made by ITS Facilities Services, the business unit is responsible for storing items. There is no ITS centralized warehouse area to hold furniture or miscellaneous equipment.\n\n## 4.3 Vehicles\n\nWhen a business unit determines a State Vehicle should be removed from service, the business unit must notify ITS Facilities Services. If the vehicle is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will deploy it to a new location. If ITS Facilities Services determines the vehicle will be surplused, the following actions are to be taken:\n\nIf the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to have value but is no longer needed for ITS use (i.e., items that are still in reasonably good shape and/or still function properly but are no longer needed by the business unit), a CS-201 Form must be completed and, if applicable, the Information Security Certification must be signed. The completed form, along with digital pictures, must be sent to ITS Facilities Services at its.sm.surplus@its.ny.gov, for authorization and processing. Once all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the furniture or miscellaneous equipment drop-off with OGS.\n\nIn order to effectively surplus and dispose of items no longer of use, and which have no value, the ITS surplus and disposal process has been established based on guidelines provided by the Office of General Services (OGS) and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering.\n\nDetails regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines."

ITS Facilities Services will further notify all concerned parties that the vehicle is no longer in service.\n\nOnce all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the State Vehicle drop-off with OGS.\n\n## 5.0 Compliance\n\nITS Facilities Services will work with the business unit to review the form.

If the vehicle is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will deploy it to a new location. If ITS Facilities Services determines the vehicle will be surplused, the following actions are to be taken:\n\n## 3.0 Scope\n\nThis standard applies to all \"State Entities\" (SE), defined as \"State Government\" entities as defined in Executive Order 1171, issued January 2002, or \"State Agencies\" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law including their employees, and all third parties (e.g., local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors), that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.\n\nThis standard covers all mobile devices managed by the State or which are used by the State workforce to store SE information.\n\n## 4.0 Information Statement\n\nState Finance Law (SFL) \u00a7167 and \u00a7168 set forth the legal requirements for the transfer and disposal of State-owned personal property which has been determined to be no longer useful and may be surplused or disposed of by the State agencies having custody or control of such property excluding vehicles, which is determined by OGS.\n\n## 3.0 Scope\n\nThis policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, and interns. This policy applies to all New York State e-equipment and personal property owned and managed by ITS.\n\n## 4.0 Information Statement\n\nIt is the responsibility of each ITS business unit to understand and comply with this policy. When a business unit is in possession of ITS-owned personal property it no longer needs or uses, and it cannot be traded in to the manufacturer for credit toward purchasing a new item, either a Surplus/LDA Request must be entered into ITSM, or a CS-201 Form must be completed."

Compliance is required with all ITS policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.\n\nSince these items of personal property were purchased with government funds, the law requires agencies to follow these procedures and the OGS guidelines to recoup their value by re-using the items or selling them to the public. Willful failure to follow these procedures and the OGS guidelines is a violation of law which may result in a charge of misconduct or other penalties. Your primary responsibility as an ITS employee is to notify ITS Facilities Services when you have an item of ITS personal property (i.e., eequipment, furniture, miscellaneous equipment, and vehicles) for which you no longer have a business need.\n\nState Finance Law (SFL) \u00a7167 and \u00a7168 set forth the legal requirements for the transfer and disposal of State-owned personal property which has been determined to be no longer useful and may be surplused or disposed of by the State agencies having custody or control of such property excluding vehicles, which is determined by OGS.\n\n## 3.0 Scope\n\nThis policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, and interns.
